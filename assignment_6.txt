There are three types of exception—the checked exception, the error and the runtime exception.

When an exception occurred, if you don't handle it, the program terminates abruptly and the code past the line that caused the exception will not get executed.

"Recover From" means that the exception does not stop your program, the program can handle the exception (With the help of a try catch block) and then continue to execute.

4.

To avoid such a scenario, there are two methods to handle Python exceptions:-

Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program.
Raise – Triggers an exception manually using custom exceptions.

5.

The optional else clause contains codes to be executed if no exception occurs. The optional finally block contains codes to be executed irrespective of whether an exception occurs or not.
